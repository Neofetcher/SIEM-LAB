# SIEM-LAB
Elastic Security information and event management Lab Project 

Objective

The objective of this SIEM (Security Information and Event Management) lab project is to design and implement a comprehensive security monitoring solution that effectively detects, investigates, and responds to security incidents within an enterprise environment. Through hands-on exercises and simulations, participants will gain practical experience in configuring SIEM tools, creating custom detection rules, analyzing security events, and orchestrating incident response workflows. By the end of the project, participants will have developed a proficient understanding of SIEM technologies and best practices, equipping them with the skills necessary to enhance the security posture of organizations through proactive threat detection and mitigation.

Skills Learned 

 - Elastic Stack SIEM Configuration and Management: Successfully set up and configured Elastic Stack SIEM in a home lab environment. Demonstrated proficiency in deploying a Kali Linux VM, configuring Elastic Agents for log collection, and forwarding data to the SIEM for effective security event monitoring.
 - Security Event Simulation and Analysis: Acquired hands-on experience in generating and analyzing security events using Nmap on Kali Linux. Proficient in querying Elastic SIEM to identify and investigate security incidents, enhancing skills in network security monitoring and threat detection.
 - Visualization and Alerting in SIEM: Developed a custom dashboard in Elastic SIEM to visualize security events, demonstrating skills in data interpretation and pattern recognition. Successfully created and tested alert rules for detecting specific security events, showing competency in proactive incident response and alert management.
